imgresize - A naive script for resizing images in a directory in depth

Currently imgresize can be invoked with parameter `-dir`
and it will traverse it in depth, search for files with
extension jpg or jpeg and create their resized copies
with max with 800 and max height 700 pixels.

TODO

* Add additional parameters for the required max with and height;
* Support PNG and GIF images;
* Do not process files if they are already processed.
