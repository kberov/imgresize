Command imgresize - A naive program for resizing images in a tree of directories

Each file is processed in its own goroutine, which means imgresize should be very fast.
Currently supported file formats are JPEG, GIF and PNG.

Usage of imgresize:
  -dir string
    	root folder to search for images (default "./")
  -maxheight uint
    	maximal height of the resized image (default 800)
  -maxwidth uint
    	maximal width of the resized image (default 800)

This program depends on github.com/nfnt/resize
